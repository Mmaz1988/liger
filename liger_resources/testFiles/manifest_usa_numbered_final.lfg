#1

Meeting America's Challenges, Protecting America's Values.

#2

In 1996, America will choose the President who will lead us from the millennium which saw the birth of our nation into a future that has all the potential to be even greater than our magnificent past. 

#3

Today's Democratic Party is ready for that future. 

#4

Our vision is simple. 

#5

We want an America that gives all Americans the chance to live out their dreams and achieve their God-given potential. 

#6

We want an America that is still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom. 

#7

And we want an America that is coming together around our enduring values, instead of drifting apart. 

#8

Today's Democratic Party is determined to renew America's most basic bargain: Opportunity to every American, and responsibility from every American. 

#9

And today's Democratic Party is determined to reawaken the great sense of American community. 

#10

Opportunity. 

#11

Responsibility. 

#12

Community. 

#13

These are the values that made America strong. 

#14

These are the values of the Democratic Party. 

#15

These are the values that must guide us into the future. 

#16

Today, America is moving forward with the strong leadership it deserves. 
#17

The economy is stronger, the deficit is lower, and government is smaller. 

#18

Education is better, families are healthier, and our streets are safer. 

#19

There is more opportunity in America, more responsibility in our homes, and more peace in the world. 

#20

Today's Democratic party stands proudly on the record of the last four years. 

#21

We are living in an age of enormous possibility, and we are working to make sure that all Americans can make the most out of it. 

#22

America is moving in the right direction. 

#23

Now we must move forward, and we know the course we must follow. 

#24

We need a smaller, more effective, less bureaucratic government that reflects our time-honored values. 

#25

The American people do not want big government solutions and they do not want empty promises. 

#26

They want a course that is reasonable, help that is realistic, and solutions that can be delivered: a moderate, achievable, common-sense agenda that will improve people's daily lives and not increase the size of government. 

#27

Today's Democratic Party offers the end of the era of big government.

#28

The democratic party offers a final rejection of the misguided call to leave our citizens to fight for themselves.

#29

The Democratic party offers bold leadership into the future: To meet America's challenges, protect America's values, and fulfill American dreams. 

#30

OPPORTUNITY 

#31

President Andrew Jackson put it best: We believe in equal opportunity for all, and special privileges for none. 

#32

The mission of the Democratic Party in 1996 is to ensure that the great American Dream of opportunity for all is within reach for all.

#33

We want to ensure that it travels with us, whole and intact, as we walk together into tomorrow.

#34

Economic growth. 

#35

The combined rate of inflation, unemployment, and mortgage interest rates is the lowest in three decades. 

#36

Now, 3.7 million more Americans own their own home, and Americans have started a record number of new small businesses in each of the last three years. 

#37

Our strategy is in place, and it is working. 

#38

We are proud of our economic record over the last four years, and we know that our record is a record to build on, not to rest on. 

#39

We have to move forward, to make sure that every American willing to work hard has the opportunity to build a good life and share in the benefits of economic success. 

#40

In the next four years we have to make the new economy work for all Americans.

#41

We will do so by balancing the budget, creating more jobs and making sure all families can count on good health care and a secure retirement.

#42

Most of all, we will be expanding educational opportunities so all Americans can learn the skills they need to build the best possible future. 

#43

Balancing the budget. 

#44

The only deficit left today is interest payments on the debt run up over the 12 Republican years, before fiscal responsibility returned to the White House. 

#45

President Clinton is the first President to cut the deficit four years in a row since before the Civil War. 

#46

Now the Democratic Party is determined to finish the job and balance the budget. 

#47

President Clinton has put forward a plan to balance the budget by 2002, while living up to our commitments to our elderly and our children.

#48

Following the plan will also maintain strong economic growth. 

#49

The Republican Congress' own economists admit the President's plan will balance the budget by 2002. 

#50

It cuts hundreds of wasteful and outdated programs, but it preserves Medicare and Medicaid, it protects education and the environment, and it defends working families. 

#51

The President's plan reflects America's values. 

#52

The Republican plan does not. 

#53

Today's Democratic Party believes we have a duty to care for our parents, so they can live their lives in dignity. 

#54

That duty includes securing Medicare and Medicaid, finding savings without reducing quality or benefits, and protecting Social Security for future generations. 

#55

The Republican agenda rests on massive Medicare cuts, three times bigger than the largest Medicare cuts in history.

#56

These cuts include new premium increases on seniors, and drastic changes to Medicaid that will jeopardize the health care of children and seniors. 

#57

Today's Democratic Party believes that all children should have the opportunity to make the most out of their own lives. 

#58

We believe that schools should be run by teachers and principals, not by Washington. 

#59

The Republican agenda slashes college scholarships and college loans. cuts Head Start program.

#60

It also cuts funds to reduce class size and improve teacher standards. 

#61

Today's Democratic Party believes we have a duty to preserve God's earth and American quality of life for future generations. 

#62

We are committed to reform, so that environmental protection does not trap business in a tangle of red tape. 

#63

The Republican budget guts environmental protection. 

#64

Today's Democratic Party believes that working people should not be taxed into poverty. 

#65

The Republican budget raises taxes on millions of working families. 

#66

Today's Democratic Party believes that America must put our families first. 

#67

The Republican budget takes Big Bird away from 5-year-olds, school lunches away from 10-year- olds, summer jobs away from 15-year-olds, and college loans away from 20-year-olds. 

#68

Tax relief for working families and small businesses. 

#69

America cannot afford to return to the era of something-for-nothing tax cuts and smoke and-mirrors accounting that produced a decade of exploding deficits. 

#70

Today's Democratic Party is committed to targeted tax cuts that help working Americans invest in their future.

#71

We insist on any tax cuts being completely paid for because we are determined to balance the budget. 

#72

We want to strengthen middle-class families by providing a $500 tax cut for children. 

#73

We want to cut taxes to help families pay for education after high school, and to guarantee the first two years of college. 

#74

We want people to be able to use their IRA's to buy a first home, deal with a medical emergency, or provide for education. 

#75

We want to cut taxes for small businesses that invest in the future and set up pensions for their workers. 

#76

And we want to cut taxes for people who are self employed and self-insured so their health care is more affordable. 

#77

Technology. 

#78

We know investments in technology drive economic growth, generate new knowledge, create new high-wage jobs, build new industries, and improve our quality of life. 

#79

We support government policies that encourage private sector investment and innovation to create a pro-growth economic climate, like a permanent research and development tax credit. 

#80

We want technology to create jobs and improve the quality of life for American workers. 

#81

As we enter the 21st century, we will continue to invest in world-class research and development, advanced technologies in transportation, information and other industries, and agricultural and environmental research in partnership with American business. 

#82

We are working to reinvent the national laboratories and revitalize America's space program. 

#83

Creating jobs through trade. 

#84

We believe that if we want the American economy to continue strong growth, we must continue to expand trade, and not retreat from the world. 

#85

America's markets are open to the world, so America has a right to demand that the world's markets are open to our products. 

#86

American products are the best in the world. 

#87

When American workers and American companies have the chance to compete around the world, we do not take second place. 

#88

In the next four years, we must continue to work to lower foreign trade barriers and we must insist that foreign companies play by fair rules at home and abroad.

#89

We must strengthen the rules that protect the global economy from fraud and dangerous instability and advance American commercial interests abroad.

#90

We must ensure that the new global economy is directly beneficial to American working families. 

#91

As we work to open new markets, we must continue to guarantee that all trade agreements include standards to protect children, workers, and the environment. 

#92

We must ensure adequate trade adjustment assistance and education and training programs to help working families compete and win in the global economy. 

#93

Education. 

#94

Today's Democratic Party knows that education is the key to opportunity. 
#95

In the new global economy, it is more important than ever before. 

#96

Today, education is the fault line that separates those who will prosper from those who cannot. 

#97

Now, they want to cut education from Head Start through college scholarships. 

#98

They want to make borrowing for college more difficult for millions of students. 

#99

Today's Democratic Party will stand firmly against the Republican assault on education. 

#100

Cutting education as we move into the 21st century would be like cutting defense spending at the height of the Cold War. 

#101

We must do more to expand educational opportunity, not less. 

#102

Strengthening public schools. 

#103

In the next four years, we must do even more to make sure America has the best public schools on earth. 

#104

If we want to be the best, we should expect the best: We must hold students, teachers, and schools to the highest standards. 

#105

Students should be required to demonstrate competency and achievement for promotion or graduation. 

#106

Teachers should be required to meet high standards for performance and be rewarded for the good jobs they do.

#107

Additionally, there should be a fair, timely, cost effective process to remove those who do not measure up. 

#108

And we should get rid of the barriers that discourage talented young people from becoming teachers in the first place. 

#109

We should not bash teachers. 

#110

We should applaud them, and find ways to keep the best teachers in the classroom. 

#111

Schools should be held accountable for results. 

#112

We should redesign or shut down schools that fail. 

#113

We should expand public school choice, but we should not take American tax dollars from public schools and give them to private schools. 

#114

We should promote public charter schools that are held to the highest standards of accountability and access. 

#115

And we should continue to ensure that America provides good education to children with disabilities, because high-quality public education is the key to opportunity for all American children. 

#116

Teaching values in schools. 

#117

Today's Democratic Party knows our children's education is not complete unless they learn good values. 

#118

We applaud the efforts of the Clinton-Gore Administration to promote character education in our schools. 

#119

Teaching good values, strong character, and the responsibilities of citizenship must be an essential part of American education. 

#120

Safe schools and healthy students. 

#121

If young people do not have the freedom to learn in safety, they do not have the freedom to learn at all. 

#122

Now, we must launch a major rebuilding effort to make sure our children go to school in high-quality facilities where they can learn. 

#123

We must help schools set the highest standards for good behavior and discipline in the classroom. 

#124

Children cannot learn - and teachers cannot teach - without order in the classroom. 

#125

Technology in the classroom. 

#126

We must bring the 21st century into every classroom in America. 

#127

There is a vast realm of knowledge waiting for our children to tap into it. 

#128

Computers are powerful tools to teach students to read better, write better, and understand math. 

#129

President Clinton and Vice President Gore understand that technological literacy is essential to success in the new economy. 

#130

The only way to achieve that for every student is to give them all access to a computer, good software, trained teachers, and the Internet.

#131

For that, President Clinton and Vice President Gore have launched a partnership with high-tech companies, schools, state, and local governments.

#132

The goal of this partnership is to wire every classroom and library to the Information Superhighway by the year 2000.

#133

Preparing students for jobs. 

#134

We passed School-to-Work so young people can learn the skills they need to get and keep high wage jobs. 

#135

The Republican Congress is trying to destroy it, and we pledge to stop them. 

#136

We want to keep working with the private sector, to encourage community partnerships that build the bridge between a good education and a good job. 

#137

Higher education for all Americans. 

#138

Finally, we must make sure that every American has the opportunity to go to college. 

#139

Higher education is the key to a successful future in the 21st century. 

#140

The typical worker with a college education earns 73 percent more than one without. 

#141

America has the best higher education in the world. 

#142

We do not need to change it.

#143

Instead we need to make it available for all Americans. 

#144

Our goal must be to make the 13th and 14th years of education as universal as the first 12. 

#145

Tax cuts for college. 

#146

Over the next four years, we want to go even further: We should expand work-study so one million students a year can work their way through college by the year 2000. 

#147

We should let people use money from their IRA to help pay for college. 

#148

We should give a $1000 honor scholarship for the top 5 percent of graduates in every high school. 

#149

And we must make 14 years of education the standard for every American. 

#150

The Democratic Party wants to create a $10,000 tax deduction for families to help pay for education after high school. 

#151

And we want to create a $1,500 tax cut for Americans, modeled after Georgia's successful HOPE scholarships.

#152

The goal is to guarantee the first year of tuition at a typical community college, and the second year if individuals earn it by maintaining a B average. 

#153

The tax cut that will do most to raise American incomes is a tax cut that pays for college.

#154

Economic security for American families in the 21st century. 

#155

In the new economy, the rules have changed. 

#156

We need to find new ways to help working families find economic security.

#157

This should include better training to help workers learn skills to get new and better jobs.

#158

People should have the security of good health care and safe pensions so they can take care of themselves and their families. 

#159

This is a challenge that American workers and managers are ready to face, and the Democratic Party will continue to tackle. 

#160

Rewarding work. 

#161

We honor work in America. 

#162

Americans work hard, and they have a right to expect that work will pay. 
#163

We want to continue reversing the trend of the eighties, so all Americans benefit from continued economic growth and rising wages. 

#164

The President and Democrats in Congress are fighting against fierce Republican opposition, led by Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich, to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour.

#165

The minimum wage should be a wage you can live on. 

#166

We want to strengthen families, and we challenge the private sector to help their workers earn enough to support a family. 

#167

Health care. 

#168

The Democratic Party is committed to ensuring that Americans have access to affordable high-quality health care. 

#169

We are committed to finding a cure for breast cancer and AIDS.

#170

We are also committed to doing more to help all Americans live longer and healthier lives.

#171

The Democratic Party is proud to have held the line against the Republicans' mean-spirited Medicare and Medicaid cuts that would risk the health care of millions of Americans, from infants to seniors. 

#172

Senator Dole voted against Medicare when it was first created, and now Republican leaders want Medicare to "wither on the vine." 

#173

The Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan would put millions of our parents into a second class health care system for the first time in their lives, and we will not stand for it. 

#174

The Dole-Gingrich Medicaid plan would end the guarantee to meaningful health benefits for millions of children, older Americans, and people with disabilities. 

#175

The Democratic Party wants America to preserve and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid, so we honor our values and protect the health of our children, parents, and grandparents.

#176

We want to ensure that they can get the health care they need, from doctors' visits to long-term care. 

#177

When these plans are implemented, two million more Americans will have health insurance because of them. 

#178

Now we must finish the job by balancing the budget while we preserve and strengthen Medicare and Medicaid.

#179

This will protect millions of middle class families from being overwhelmed by health care costs for their parents, children, or disabled family members.

#180

We must move forward to reform our health care system.

#181

Insurance companies must be stopped from denying coverage to families where one member has a preexisting condition.

#182

Additionally, we must make sure that people can take their health insurance with them when they change jobs. 

#183

No more Americans should have to turn down a better job because they would lose their health care if they took it. 

#184

We are taking steps to ensure that Americans have access to quality, affordable health care.

#185

We should start by making sure that people get help paying premiums so they do not lose health care while they're looking for a new job. 

#186

We support expanded coverage of home care, hospice, and community-based services, so the elderly and people with disabilities of all ages can live in their own communities and as independently as possible. 

#187

Retirement. 

#188

We recognize the unique concerns of women when it comes to preparing for retirement and have worked to protect women's pension rights. 

#189

We want to take further steps to ensure that Americans who have worked hard for their whole lives can enjoy their retirement in the dignity and security they have earned.

#190

We want to make sure people can carry their pensions with them when they change jobs.

#191

We want to protect pensions even further, and expand the number of workers with pension coverage. 

#192

Democrats created Social Security, we oppose efforts to dismantle it, and we will fight to save it. 

#193

We must ensure that it is on firm financial footing well into the next century. 

#194

Social security has provided true security for millions of older Americans for decades.

#195

We call on Republicans to put politics aside and join us in a serious bipartisan effort to ensure that Social Security will continue to provide true security for future generations.

#196

Training. 

#197

We must do more to make sure all Americans have the skills they need to compete. 

#198

We want a G.I. Bill for Workers.

#199

The goal is to transform the confusing tangle of federal training programs into a simple job-training skill grant.

#200

This grant will go directly to unemployed workers so they will be able to get the training that is right for them. 

#201

We want to strengthen training opportunities for people with disabilities, so they can learn the skills they need to live independent, productive lives. 

#202

Standing up for working Americans. 

#203

We are reforming OSHA so it can do a better job to protect worker safety with less red tape, and we continue to oppose Republican efforts to gut it. 

#204

We beat back efforts to undermine workers' rights to form and join unions and to dismantle the enforcement powers of the National Labor Relations Board. 

#205

We vigorously oppose Republican efforts to pass Right-to-Work legislation, and to undermine collective bargaining through the TEAM Act. 

#206

We are working to eradicate sweatshops in the U.S. apparel industry by stepping up enforcement and public education. 

#207

We oppose the hiring of permanent workers to replace lawful economic strikers; we support the President's action to stop the government from procuring goods and services from companies that do so; and we support legislation to prohibit the permanent replacement of lawfully striking workers. 

#208

We believe in equal pay for equal work and pay equity. 

#209

Promoting economic growth and opportunity for all Americans. 

#210

We know that America profits, when small, minority, and women-owned businesses have the opportunity to grow and prosper.

#211

These business-owners create new jobs, expand opportunities, and serve as powerful role models for young people. 

#212

Corporate citizenship. 

#213

Employers have a responsibility to do their part as well. 

#214

President Clinton and the Democratic Party stand on the side of working families. 

#215

We believe that values like loyalty, fairness, and responsibility are not inconsistent with the bottom line. 

#216

We call on our corporate leaders to invest in the long-term, by providing workers with good wages and benefits, and education and training.

#217

They should also provide opportunities for greater involvement in company decision making. 

#218

As workers increase their productivity, employers should make sure they share in the benefits of the good years, as well as share the burdens of the bad ones. 

#219

Employers should respect the commitment of workers to their families, and should work to provide good pensions and health care. 

#220

When CEOs put their workers and long-term success ahead of short-term gain, their workers and the CEOs will do better.

#221

RESPONSIBILITY 

#222

Today's Democratic Party knows that the era of big government is over. 

#223

Big bureaucracies and Washington solutions do not have the real answers to today's challenges. 

#224

We need a smaller government, and we must have a larger national spirit. 
#225

Government's job should be to give people the tools they need to make the most out of their own lives. 

#226

Americans must take the responsibility to use them, to build good lives for themselves and their families. 

#227

Personal responsibility is the most powerful force we have to meet our challenges and shape the future we want for ourselves, for our children, and for America. 

#228

Fighting crime. 

#229

Today's Democratic Party believes the first responsibility of government is law and order.  

#230

The Democratic Party under President Clinton is putting more police on the streets and tougher penalties on the books.

#231

We are taking guns off the streets.

#232

And we are working to steer young people away from crime, gangs and drugs in the first place. 

#233

And it is making a difference. 

#234

In city after city and town after town, crime rates are finally coming down. 

#235

Community policing. 

#236

Nothing is more effective in the fight against crime than police officers on the beat, engaged in community policing. 

#237

The Crime Bill is putting 100,000 new police officers on the street. 

#238

We deplore cynical Republican attempts to undermine our promise to America to put 100,000 new police officers on the street. 

#239

We pledge to stand up for our communities and stand with our police officers by opposing any attempt to repeal or weaken this effort. 

#240

But we know that community policing only works when the community works with the police. 

#241

We echo the President's challenge to Americans: If 50 citizens joined each of America's 20.000 neighborhood watch groups, we would have a citizen force of one million strong to give our police forces the backup they need. 

#242

Protecting our children, our neighborhoods, and our police from criminals with guns. 

#243

We oppose efforts to restrict weapons that are used for legitimate sporting purposes, and we are proud that not one hunter or sportsman was forced to change guns because of the assault weapons ban. 

#244

But we know that the military-style guns we banned have no place on America's streets.

#245

And we are proud of the courageous Democrats who defied the gun lobby and sacrificed their seats in Congress to make America safer. 

#246

Today's Democratic Party stands with America's police officers. 

#247

We are proud to tell them that as long as Bill Clinton and Al Gore are in the White House, any attempt to repeal the Brady Bill will be met with a veto. 

#248

Any attempt to ban assault weapons will also be met with a veto.

#249

We must do everything we can to stand behind our police officers, and the first thing we should do is pass a ban on cop-killer bullets. 

#250

Any bullet that can rip through a bulletproof vest should be against the law; that is the least we can do to protect the brave police officers who risk their lives to protect us. 

#251

Tough punishment. 

#252

We believe that people who break the law should be punished, and people who commit violent crimes should be punished severely. 

#253

We call on the states to meet the President's challenge and guarantee that serious violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentence. 

#254

The American people deserve a criminal justice system in which criminals are caught, the guilty people are convicted, and the convicted people serve their time. 

#255

Fighting youth crime and violence. 

#256

Nothing we do to fight crime is more important than fighting the crime and violence that threatens our children. 

#257

We have to protect them from criminals who prey on them.

#258

We have to teach them good values and give them a perspective, so they stay away from crime and trouble in the first place.

#259

The Democratic Party understands what the police have been saying for years: The best way to fight crime is to prevent it. 

#260

We support well thought out, well organized, highly supervised youth programs to provide young people with a safe and healthy alternative to hanging out on the streets. 

#261

At the same time, when young people cross the line, they must be punished. 

#262

When young people commit serious violent crimes, they should be prosecuted like adults. 

#263

If Senator Dole and the Republicans are serious about fighting juvenile crime, they should listen to America's police officers.

#264

They should support the steps Democrats have taken, because they are making a difference, and then they should join us as we work to do more. 
#265

We want parents to bring order to their children's lives and teach them right from wrong, and we want to make it easier for them to take that responsibility. 

#266

We support schools that adopt school uniform policies, to promote discipline and respect. 

#267

We support community-based curfews to keep kids off the street after a certain time, so they're safe from harm and away from trouble. 

#268

We urge schools and communities to enforce truancy laws: Young people belong in school, not on the street. 

#269

We also know that we must do everything we can to help families protect their children, especially from dangerous criminals who have made a dark habit of preying on young people. 

#270

Study after study shows that sex offenders are likely to repeat their crimes again and again. 

#271

We support the President's directive to the Attorney General, calling on her to work with the states and Congress to develop a national sex offender registry. 

#272

This will ensure that police officers in every state can get the information they need from any state to track sex offenders down.

#273

It also ensure that they get the information to bring them to justice when they commit new crimes.

#274

Battling illegal drugs. 

#275

We must keep drugs off our streets and out of our schools. 

#276

We support the President's decision to tell those who commit crimes and peddle drugs in public housing: You will get no second chance to threaten your neighbors; it is one strike and you're out. 

#277

We are making progress. 

#278

Overall drug use in America is dropping; the number of Americans who use cocaine has dropped 30 percent since 1992. 

#279

Unfortunately casual drug use by young people continues to climb. 

#280

We must redouble our efforts against drug abuse everywhere, especially among our children. 

#281

General McCaffrey is implementing an aggressive four part strategy to reach young children and prevent drug use in the first place.

#282

This is also implemented to catch and punish drug users and dealers and to provide treatment to those who need help.

#283

Lastly it is implemented to cut drugs off at the source before they cross the border and pollute our neighborhoods. 

#284

But every adult in America must take responsibility to set a good example, and to teach children that drugs are wrong, they are illegal, and they are deadly. 

#285

Ending domestic violence. 

#286

When it strikes, nothing is a more dangerous threat to the safety of our families than domestic violence, because it is a threat from within. 

#287

Unfortunately, violence against women is no stranger to America, but a dangerous intruder we must work together to drive from our homes. 

#288

We know that domestic violence is not a 'family problem" or "a women's problem." 

#289

It is America's problem, and we must all fight it. 

#290

The Violence Against Women Act in the 1994 Crime Bill helps police officers, prosecutors, and judges to understand domestic violence.

#291

It helps them recognize it when they see it, and know how to deal with it. 

#292

Everyone who knows it should pass it on to anyone who might need it. 

#293

Every American must take the responsibility to stop this terrible scourge. 

#294

As we fight it, we must remember that the victims are not to blame. 

#295

This is a crime to be punished, not a secret to be concealed. 

#296

We must do everything we can to make sure that the victims of violent crime are treated with the respect and the dignity they deserve. 

#297

We support the President's call for a constitutional amendment to protect the rights of victims. 

#298

We believe that when a criminal is sentenced, or a defendant is let out on bail, the victims ought to know about it.

#299

Similarly we believe that when a plea bargain is entered in public, the victims ought to know about it. 

#300

A constitutional amendment is the only way to protect those rights in every courtroom in America. 

#301

Immigration. 

#302

Democrats remember that we are a nation of immigrants. 

#303

We recognize the extraordinary contribution of immigrants to America throughout our history. 

#304

We welcome legal immigrants to America. 

#305

We support a legal immigration policy that is pro-family, pro work, pro responsibility, and pro-citizenship, and we deplore those who blame immigrants for a nation of laws. 

#306

We cannot tolerate illegal immigration and we must stop it. 

#307

For years before Bill Clinton became President, Washington talked tough but failed to act. 

#308

President Clinton is making the Southwest border a place where the law is respected and drugs and illegal immigrants are turned away. 

#309

However as we work to stop illegal immigration, we call on all Americans to avoid the temptation to use this issue to divide people from each other. 

#310

We deplore those who use the need to stop illegal immigration as a pretext for discrimination. 

#311

And we applaud the wisdom of Republicans like Mayor Giuliani and Senator Domenici who oppose the mean-spirited and short-sighted effort of Republicans in Congress to bar the children of illegal immigrants from schools.

#312

Barring the children of illegal immigrants from schools is wrong and forcing children onto the streets is an invitation for them to join gangs and turn to crime. 

#313

Democrats want to protect American jobs by increasing criminal and civil sanctions against employers who hire illegal workers, but Republicans continue to favor inflammatory rhetoric over real action. 

#314

We will continue to enforce labor standards to protect workers in vulnerable industries. 

#315

We continue to firmly oppose welfare benefits for illegal immigrants. 

#316

We believe family members who sponsor immigrants into this country should take financial responsibility for them, and be held legally responsible for supporting them. 

#317

Welfare reform. 

#318

Today's Democratic Party knows there is no greater gap between mainstream American values and modern American government than our failed welfare system. 

#319

The welfare system should reflect those values: we want to help people who want to help themselves and their children. 

#320

Welfare rolls are finally coming down: There are 1.3 million fewer people on welfare today than there were when President Clinton took office in January 1993. 

#321

Now we must finish the job, and pass national welfare reform. 

#322

That is the wrong approach. 

#323

We should be tough on work and demand responsibility, but we should not punish children for their parents' mistakes. 

#324

A real bipartisan welfare reform plan should require that anyone on welfare, who can work, goes to work. 

#325

And we should provide child care and health care so parents can work. 

#326

We should impose strict time limits so that no one who can work can stay on welfare forever. 

#327

We should require minor mothers to live with their parents or another responsible adult. 

#328

If the Republican Party puts politics aside, we can finish the job President Clinton started, and end welfare as we know it across America. 
#329

Passing legislation is not enough and we should make sure, that people get the skills they need to get jobs.

#330

We should also ensure, that there are jobs for them, so that they leave welfare and stay off. 

#331

Welfare reform should put more people to work and move them into the economic mainstream, not take jobs away from working families. 

#332

Child support. 

#333

Nobody has the right to walk away from the responsibility to care for his or her children. 

#334

If you owe child support, paying it fully and promptly is just the first step in living up to your responsibility as a parent. 

#335

President Clinton, Congressional Democrats, and Democratic governors all know that the toughest possible child support enforcement must be a central part of any real welfare reform plan.

#336

This includes the President's plan to deny drivers licenses and professional licenses to people who do not pay their child support. 

#337

We must tell deadbeats: If you neglect your responsibility to your children, we will suspend your license, garnish your wages, track you down, and make you pay. 

#338

Teen pregnancy. 

#339

But we all know it is still far too high. 

#340

Government alone cannot solve this problem. 

#341

We must send the strongest possible signal to young people:

#342

It is wrong to get pregnant or father a child until they are married and ready to support that child and raise that child. 

#343

We also know that half of all underage mothers were made pregnant by a man in his twenties, or even older. 

#344

Statutory rape is a crime, but unfortunately the laws that protect young women from it are almost never enforced. 

#345

We echo the President's call to America's prosecutors: Enforce the statutory rape laws vigorously against men who prey on underage women. 

#346

Choice. 

#347

The Democratic Party stands behind the right of every woman to choose and regardless of ability to pay. 

#348

This is consistent with Roe V. Wade.

#349

We believe it is a fundamental constitutional liberty that individual Americans - not government - can best take responsibility for making the most difficult and intensely personal decisions regarding reproduction. 

#350

The Democratic Party is a party of inclusion. 

#351

We respect the individual conscience of each American on this difficult issue, and we welcome all our members to participate at every level of our party. 

#352

Our goal is to make abortion less necessary and more rare, not more difficult and more dangerous. 

#353

We support contraceptive research, family planning, comprehensive family life education, and policies that support healthy pregnancy. 

#354

The abortion rate is dropping. 

#355

Now we must continue to support efforts to reduce unintended pregnancies, and we call on all Americans to take personal responsibility to meet this important goal. 

#356

Reinventing government. 

#357

The American people have a right to demand that responsibility is the order of the day in Washington. 

#358

The mission of today's Democratic Party is to expand opportunity, not bureaucracy. 

#359

The federal government is eliminating 16,000 pages of outdated and unnecessary regulations, has abolished 179 programs and projects, and saved taxpayers billions of dollars. 

#360

This stops Congress from requiring state and local governments to implement expensive policies, without providing any way to pay for them.

#361

This encourages better partnerships and more balance of resources and responsibilities. 

#362

Democrats are bringing responsibility back to Washington. 

#363

Nobody should ever shut down the government again. 

#364

Democrats believe government should work better and cost less, not work less and cost more. 

#365

Thanks to them our streets are safer, our water is cleaner, and our nation is secure. 

#366

Front-line federal workers committed to providing quality services have joined the President's efforts to make government work better for the American people. 

#367

With their help, we are saving money for the taxpayers and improving services for our people. 

#368

Americans with life-threatening diseases like cancer and AIDS gain access to new drugs faster, because the Food and Drug Administration has streamlined its approval process, become more flexible in certifications, and eliminated unnecessary paperwork. 

#369

American home buyers are saving an average of $1,000 in closing costs because the Department of Housing and Urban Development has eliminated paperwork and other unnecessary burdens. 

#370

Over the next four years, the Democratic Party will continue to make responsibility the rule in Washington.

#371

We will be cutting bureaucracy further, improving customer service and demanding better performance.

#372

We will be holding people and agencies accountable for producing the best results.

#373

We will be ensuring that all Americans have access to high quality public services.

#374

Lastly we  will be forging new partnerships with the private sector.

#375

This will includw small, minority, and women-owned businesses.

#376

There will also be partnerships with state and local governments. 

#377

Political reform. 

#378

Today's Democratic Party knows that we have a responsibility to make our democracy work better for America.

#379

We make our democracy work better for America by limiting the influence of special interests and expanding the influence of the American people.

#380

Special interests have too much power in the halls of government. 

#381

They often operate in secret and have special privileges ordinary Americans do not even know exist. 

#382

But we must take further strong action. 

#383

The President and the Democratic Party support the bipartisan McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. 

#384

It will limit campaign spending, curb the influence of PACs and lobbyists, and end the soft money system. 

#385

Perhaps most important of all, this bill provides free TV time for candidates.

#386

With that they can talk directly to citizens about real issues and real ideas. 

#387

Unfortunately, Republicans in Congress will not even let this bill come up for a vote. 

#388

We call on them to stop stonewalling. 

#389

It is time to take the reins of democracy away from big money and put them back in the hands of the American people, where they belong. 

#390

We applaud efforts by broadcasters and private citizens alike, to increase candidates' direct access to voters through free TV. 

#391

Finally, we believe all Americans have a right to fair political representation, including the citizens of the District of Columbia which deserves statehood. 

#392

We recognize the existing status of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the strong economic relationship between the people of Puerto Rico and the United States. 

#393

We pledge to support the right of the people of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to choose freely, and in concert with the U.S. Congress their relationship with the United States, either as an enhanced commonwealth, a state or an independent nation.

#394

Today, peace initiatives are helping democracy and free markets take root throughout the region.

#395

Russian troops are out of the Baltics, and democracy has triumphed in Russia's elections. 

#396

Today, in the Middle East, we have seen real agreements toward peace, and handshakes of history. 

#397

The people of Northern Ireland have seen a cease-fire and the first negotiations among the parties.

#398

Today, that program is frozen, under international inspection, and slated to be dismantled. 

#399

Today, NATO is keeping the peace in Bosnia with its Partnership for Peace allies.

#400

As a result of American leadership, the NATO is preparing to welcome new members from Central Europe.

#401

Four years ago, America stood aloof as war and genocide spread through the former Yugoslavia. 

#402

Thanks to NATO airstrikes, American diplomacy and the deployment of troops from the U.S. and other nations, the war has now stopped and Bosnia has its first real chance for a lasting peace. 

#403

Today, the dictators are gone, democracy has been restored, and Haiti's mass-exodus has stopped. 

#404

Now, following the 1994 elections - which the United States strongly supported - there is a national unity government and South Africa is free and democratic. 

#405

Today America's relations with our trading parties around the world are stronger than ever.

#406

For that, the Clinton Administration efforts to find new markets for American products and strengthen our existing ties have to be thanked.

#407

We applaud efforts like the Summit of the Americas, the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings, and, especially, the extraordinary leadership of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown on behalf of American industry and workers everywhere. 

#408

Ron Brown will always be remembered with great pride and the deepest gratitude by the Democratic Party and by all Americans. 

#409

Today's Democratic Party is unwilling to surrender to the voices of retreat and indifference. 

#410

We believe the only way to ensure America's security and prosperity over the long run is to continue exerting American leadership across a range of military, diplomatic, and humanitarian, challenges around the world. 

#411

Led by President Clinton and Vice President Gore, today's Democratic Party has set a far reaching agenda to strengthen our security, and to promote peace and freedom. 

#412

Strengthening our security. 

#413

The highest imperative for our security is the protection of our people, our territory, and our key interests abroad. 

#414

While both parties share a commitment to strong security, there is a real difference. 

#415

The Republican desire to spend more money on defense than the Pentagon requests cannot obscure their inability to recognize the challenges of a new era and build the balanced defenses we need to meet them. 

#416

Today's Democratic Party is committed to strengthening our military and adapting it to new challenges; reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction; and meeting new challenges to our security such as terrorism, international crime, and drug trafficking. 

#417

Strengthening our military. 

#418

We will continue our work to ensure that the men and women who wear American uniforms receive adequate pay and support.

#419

This includes childcare, housing, and access to quality health care for themselves and their families. 

#420

The Administration defense plan reverses the downward trend in procurement with a 40% real increase for weapons modernization by 2001. 

#421

At the same time the Administration has fundamentally reformed government procurement rules, in order to get most out of our money.

#422

Use Of Force. 

#423

The United States must be prepared to use military force ecisively when necessary to defend our vital interests. 

#424

The burdens of collective security in a new era must be shared in a fair way, and we should encourage multilateral maintaining of peace through the United Nations and other nternational efforts. 

#425

Preventing and Containing Conflict. 

#426

American policy must be focused on averting military threats as well as meeting them. 

#427

To halt the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, we must lead renewed international effort to get tough with companies that peddle nuclear nd chemical warfare technologies, strengthen the International Atomic Energy gency, and enforce strong sanctions against governments that violate nternational restraints. 

#428

A Comprehensive Test Ban would strengthen our bility to stop the spread of nuclear weapons to other countries, which may be ur greatest future security threat. 

#429

We must press for strong international imits on the dangerous and wasteful flow of conventional arms to troubled egions. 

#430

We will encourage Congress to ratify the START-II-Treaty with Russia, which will reduce nuclear stockpiles by further 25%. 

#431

The Democratic Party is committed to build on this record by fully funding the Pentagon's 5-year defense plan.

#432

This includes undertaking a second fundamental review of our defense structure.y

#433

This also includes finding new ways for our service branches to work jointly to increase our war fighting capabilities.

#434

Finally, this includes ensuring that our troops can dominate the battlefield of the future. 

#435

We honor America's veterans; they put their lives on the line to protect our way of life and promote our values around the world. 

#436

Today's Democratic Party will stand by America's duty to our veterans. 

#437

Reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction. 

#438

Strengthening our security also requires an aggressive effort against weapons of mass destruction - nuclear, chemical, and biological - and their means of delivery. 

#439

From the nuclear weapons programs in Iraq and North Korea to the Sarin gas attack in the Tokyo subway, our nation has seen that this threat is clear and present. 

#440

To meet it, we must seize the opportunities presented by the end of the Cold War to cut weapons of mass destruction stockpiles while working to prevent lethal weapons and materials from falling into the wrong hands. 

#441

The Democratic Party supports efforts to sign a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year and to bring it into force as soon as possible. 

#442

We support immediate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, delayed too long by the Dole Senate. 

#443

We support full funding of the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program to ensure that nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union do not fall into the wrong hands. 

#444

We support vigilant efforts, in cooperation with the Republic of Korea, Japan, and others, to ensure North Korea fully abides by its agreements to dismantle its nuclear program.

#445

We also support the Administration's vigorous efforts to prevent Iraq, Iran, and other dangerous states from acquiring or developing weapons of mass destruction. 

#446

The Democratic Party is committed to a strong and balanced National Missile Defense program. 

#447

The Administration is spending $3 billion a year on six different systems to protect our troops in the field and our allies from short and medium range missiles. 

#448

To prepare for the possibility of a long range missile attack on American soil by a rogue state, the Clinton Administration is committed to developing by the year 2000 a defensive system.

#449

Such a system could be deployed by 2003, well before the threat becomes real. 

#450

The Democratic Party opposes the Republican NMD-plan, spending up to $60 billion on a revival of the Star-Wars-program.

#451

That would force us to choose a costly system today that could be obsolete tomorrow. 

#452

The Republican plan would waste money, weaken America's defenses and violate existing arms control agreements that make us more secure. 

#453

It is the wrong way to defend America. 

#454

Meeting new challenges. 

#455

Today's Democratic Party knows that stronger security requires vigorous efforts to address the new dangers of this era. 

#456

Chief among these are the interwoven threats of terrorism, drug trafficking, and international crime. 

#457

We have seen the terrible toll they have exacted: The murder of American soldiers in their barracks in Saudi Arabia and of innocent civilians on buses in Israel; corruption and crime from the former Soviet Union to Latin America. 

#458

We know these vicious criminals pay no heed to borders; we have seen firsthand the awful, evil work of the forces of terror at the World Trade Center and in Oklahoma City. 

#459

And we know all too well the havoc drugs wreak when they cross our borders and flow through our neighborhoods. 

#460

Today's Democratic Party is determined to keep the war on global terrorism, narcotics, and crime at the center of our security agenda. 

#461

We will seek increased cooperation from our allies and friends abroad in fighting these threats. 

#462

We will continue to work aggressively to shut off foreign drug flows, eradicate foreign drug crops, and assist countries that demonstrate active cooperation. 

#463

Promoting peace and democracy. 

#464

Today's Democratic Party knows that peace and democracy are products of decisive strength and active diplomacy. 

#465

Diplomacy must protect our interests while also projecting our values. 

#466

At its core, the Republican Party is locked in a Cold War mentality, and lacks a coherent strategy to nurture and strengthen the global progress toward peace and democracy. 

#467

The Democratic Party believes a key to strengthening peace is stable and peaceful relations among the world's major powers. 

#468

We are committed to promoting democracy in regions and countries important to America's security, and to standing with all those willing to take risks for peace, from the Middle East to Northern Ireland. 

#469

And we are committed to doing it with all the tools we have.

#470

We want to achieve it with diplomacy where it is possible, with force where it is necessary.

#471

And we want to work with others where it is appropriate - our allies, willing partners, the U.N. and other security organizations - to share the risks and costs of our leadership. 

#472

Europe and the former Soviet Union. 

#473

Today's Democratic Party knows that the security of Europe remains a vital American interest. 

#474

We applaud the Clinton-Gore Administration's efforts to foster a peaceful, democratic and undivided Europe.

#475

This includes expanded support for reform in former communist states; dramatically increased assistance to Ukraine; the Partnership for Peace program of military cooperation with Europe's new democracies; its steady, determined work to add new Central European members to NATO in the near future; and its efforts to resolve regional disputes such as between Greece and Turkey. 

#476

We support continued efforts to secure a just and lasting peace in Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Cyprus. 

#477

We are committed to the success of independence in Ukraine and the Baltics. 

#478

And we support the continuing evolution of a prosperous and peaceful Russia. 

#479

And as part of our effort to support we will pursue a relationship in which we seek cooperation when we can, and frankly express disagreements where they exist, such as on Chechnya. 

#480

Asia. 

#481

We know that many of America's most pressing security challenges and most promising commercial opportunities lie in the Asia Pacific region. 

#482

The Democratic Party applauds the important new security charter with Japan, the Administration's close cooperation with the Republic of Korea toward the goal of a unified and non-nuclear peninsula, and the deployment of an American naval task force to the Taiwan Straits to ensure that China's military exercises did not imperil the security of the region. 

#483

The Party supports the Administration's policy of steady engagement to encourage a stable, open and prosperous China.

#484

A China that respects human rights throughout its land and in Tibet.

#485

A China that joins international efforts against weapons proliferation and that plays by the rules of free and fair trade. 

#486

Today's Democratic Party strongly supports continued American troop presence in East Asia and efforts to promote increased regional security. 

#487

And we are committed to building long-term relationships with India, Pakistan, and others in South Asia in order to advance America's diverse interests in that region, from democracy and commerce to nuclear non-proliferation. 

#488

The Middle East. 

#489

The Democratic Party is committed to help build on this record, knowing that peace and security are indivisible. 

#490

The Democratic Party remains committed to America's long-standing special relationship with Israel, based on shared values, a mutual commitment to democracy and a strategic alliance that benefits both nations. 

#491

The United States should continue to help Israel maintain its qualitative edge so that Israel has the confidence to pursue peace. 

#492

Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths. 

#493

We also support close ties with states and peoples in the Arab and Islamic world committed to non- aggression and willing to take risks for peace. 

#494

Latin America. 

#495

Today, every country in the Hemisphere is a democracy except Cuba. 

#496

Because democratic stability and prosperity in the countries to our south are in their interest and ours, President Clinton took bold steps to bolster Mexico's economy when it was threatened by crisis.

#497

He worked to resolve internal and border conflicts in the Hemisphere and joined with regional partners to combat narcotics trafficking.

#498

Finally, he maintained a tough embargo against Cuba while reaching out to its people. 

#499

The Democratic Party is committed to further consolidating democracy, stability, and open markets throughout the hemisphere. 

#500

Africa. 

#501

The Democratic Party believes that continuing to help the people of Africa nurture their continent's extraordinary potential and address its serious problems is the right thing to do and profoundly in America's interest. 

#502

Promoting democracy. 

#503

America remains a beacon of hope to all who cherish democracy and human rights, and America's security benefits from the enlargement of the community of market democracies. 

#504

The Democratic Party supports the aspirations of all those who seek to strengthen civil society and accountable governance. 

#505

To this end, we support continued funding for the National Endowment for Democracy, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the Asia Pacific Network, Radio Marti and other efforts to promote democracy and the free flow of ideas. 

#506

Promoting Democracy Discussion Resources for diplomacy. 

#507

There is a price to be paid for America's security and its leadership in world affairs

#508

And the Republican Party now refuses to pay that price. 

#509

Even though less than 1% of the federal budget goes to foreign policy spending the Republican Party has savaged our diplomatic readiness.

#510

They defaulted on treaty obligations to pay dues to the United Nations and slashed assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable populations on earth.

#511

Additionally, they pushed the United States to dead last among developed nations in the global fight against starvation, infant mortality, natural disasters and environmental degradation and other worldwide problems. 

#512

The Democratic Party understands that these efforts strengthen our security and express our values, and strongly supports the Clinton-Gore Administration's work to ensure adequate resources for American foreign policy. 

#513

COMMUNITY 

#514

Across America, in far too many places, the bonds of community that tie us together and remind us that we rise or fall together, have too often frayed. 

#515

Today's Democratic Party believes we must reawaken the strong sense of community that has helped America to prosper for 220 years. 

#516

America is uniquely suited to lead the world into the 21st century because of our great diversity and our shared values. 

#517

We must never let our differences divide us from each other; instead we must come together on a new common ground, based on the enduring values we share. 

#518

Americans need to work together in our homes, our schools, our houses of worship, our civic groups and our businesses.

#519

Then we can meet any challenge, and realize every dream. 

#520

Putting families first. 

#521

The first and most sacred responsibility of every parent is to cherish our children and strengthen our families. 

#522

The family is the foundation of American life. 

#523

We support the fundamental themes of the Families First Agenda, promoting paycheck, health care, retirement, and personal security.

#524

This means creating greater educational and economic opportunity, and requiring greater responsibility from individuals, businesses, and government. 

#525

Standing up for parents. 

#526

Americans blessed with a new child or troubled by a family health crisis can no longer be forced to choose between their families and their jobs. 
#527

This law is good for families, it is good for America, and it would not be the law today without the Democratic Party. 

#528

Now we want to take the next step. 

#529

We believe that parents should be able to take unpaid leave from work and choose flexible times so that they can do their job as parents.

#530

This means doing things like go to parent-teacher conferences or take a child to the doctor. 

#531

We support tax credits to encourage adoption, because every child deserves a mother and father who will love them and raise them. 

#532

Responsible entertainment. 

#533

President Clinton and Vice President Gore have led the fight to help parents control what their children see on television. 

#534

Senator Dole likes to talk about TV violence, but when it was time to act, he stood with a small minority to oppose the bipartisan V-chip bill. 

#535

When parents control the remote control, it is not censorship, but personal responsibility for their children's upbringing. 

#536

We believe in public support for the arts, and especially for high-quality, family-friendly programming. 

#537

We echo the President's call to the entertainment industry: Work harder to develop and promote movies, music, and TV shows that are suitable - and educational - for children. 

#538

Tobacco. 

#539

Cigarette smoking is rapidly becoming the single greatest threat to the health of our children. 

#540

We know that 3,000 young people start smoking every day, and 1,000 of them will lead shorter lives because of it. 

#541

Despite that, Senator Dole and other Republicans continue to ignore volumes of medical research to make baffling claims that cigarettes are not addictive. 

#542

They even argue with distinguished Republican experts like President Reagan's Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. 

#543

President Clinton and Vice President Gore understand that we have a responsibility to protect our children's future by cracking down on illegal sales of tobacco to minors.

#544

Another measure is curbing sophisticated advertising campaigns directed at kids.

#545

These are designed to entice kids to start smoking before they are old enough to make an informed decision.

#546

We believe tobacco companies should market to adults if they wish, but take the responsibility to draw the line on children. 

#547

Parents' responsibility. 

#548

All of this is important, and we pledge to continue to fight for ways to strengthen our families. 

#549

But today's Democratic Party knows that governments do not raise children, but parents do. 

#550

Now we challenge every parent to put their children first.

#551

We challenge them to help them with their homework, to read to them, to know their teachers.

#552

And above all, to teach their children right from wrong and set the best example. 

#553

Community empowerment. 

#554

Today's Democratic Party understands that we cannot rebuild our poorest communities by imposing cookie-cutter solutions from Washington. 

#555

We have to give communities the tools they need to create opportunity. 

#556

Citizens, local government, the private sector, and civic groups must come together and take the responsibility to rebuild their communities from the bottom up. 

#557

Encouraging private sector investment, and community-based solutions. 

#558

Together, these efforts are unleashing billions of dollars in new private sector lending and investment for housing and economic development in our inner cities and poorest rural areas. 

#559

Over the next four years, we want a second round of Empowerment Zones to bring economic growth to more American communities; a significant expansion of the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund to spur more private sector investment in local economies: and a new tax incentive to encourage further cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields. 
#560

Today's Democratic Party knows the best way to bring jobs and growth back to our poorest neighborhoods.

#561

This way is to harness the job-creating power of the private sector. 

#562

Helping people afford safe, secure housing. 

#563

Safe, secure housing is an essential part of strong communities and strong families. 

#564

We are proud that after four years of a Democrat in the White House, the percentage of people who own their own house climbed faster than it has in 30 years. 

#565

We pledge to stand against Republican efforts to repeal the deductibility of home mortgage interest payments. 

#566

This tax credit is making it easier for families to get housing, and we will stand against Republican attacks on it. 

#567

In the next four years, we want to transform the worst public housing system that traps people in rundown, crime-ridden projects.

#568

We want to transform it into a system which gives families the freedom to choose where they live.

#569

We want to achieve this by providing vouchers to help them with housing costs. 

#570

Agriculture and the rural community. 

#571

America has the most abundant agricultural economy on earth, and it must be preserved and strengthened as we enter a new century. 

#572

We are committed to expanding agricultural exports by reducing unfair subsidies and trade barriers around the world. 

#573

Protecting our environment. 

#574

Today's Democratic party wants all Americans to be able to enjoy America's magnificent natural heritage.

#575

And we want our people to know that the air they breathe is pure, the water they drink is clean, and the land they live on is safe from hazard. 

#576

We understand we have a sacred obligation to protect God's earth and preserve our quality of life for our children and our children's children.

#578

We believe that America's elected officials have a responsibility to protect America's families from threats to their health.

#579

And we believe that trust must never be abdicated.

#580

Especially not by placing control of environmental safeguards in the hands of the very polluters that those safeguards are meant to keep in line. 

#581

We believe that America should insist that toxic waste cleanup is paid for by those who are responsible for it, and not foisted off on the taxpayers.

#583

We believe we can create more jobs over the long run by cleaning the environment. 

#584

We want to challenge businesses and communities to take more initiative in protecting the environment, and we want to make it easier for them to do it.

President Clinton and Vice President Gore launched Project-XL.

#586

It tells businesses: If you can find a cheaper, more efficient way than government regulations require to meet even tougher pollution goals, do it, as long as you do it right. 

#587

This new approach offers business flexibility, incentives, and accountability. 

#588

Environmental protection should include more education on compliance for small and medium sized business, more strategies to increase compliance for all businesses, and tough enforcement - including criminal prosecution - for those who put human health and the environment at risk. 

#589

We are committed to protecting the majestic legacy of our National Parks and enhancing recreational opportunities; restoring the Florida Everglades; preserving our wildlife refuges and fighting off any effort to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. 

#590

We will be good stewards of our old-growth forests.

#591

And we will oppose new offshore oil drilling and mineral exploration and production in our nation's many areas that are environmentally critical.

#592

And protect our oceans from oil spills and the dumping of toxic and radioactive waste. 

#593

We will continue to support responsible recycling, and encourage energy efficiency that makes our economy more efficient and less reliant on foreign oil.

#597

Democrats recognize that sustainable development is the key to protecting the environment and promoting economic growth. 

#598

At home, Democrats know that sound economic development means sound environmental protection. 

#599

The American community. 

#600

Today's Democratic Party knows that when America is divided we will likely fail, but when America is united we will always prevail. 

#601

Americans will always have differences, and when we reach across those differences, we are stronger for it. 

#602

And we share an abiding set of values that define us as Americans. 

#603

Our task is to draw strength from our great diversity and our constant values to fashion the future we want for our children. 

#604

Fighting discrimination and protecting civil rights. 

#605

Today's Democratic Party knows we must renew our efforts to stamp out discrimination and hatred of every kind, wherever and whenever we see it. 

#606

We deplore the recent wave of burnings that has targeted African-American churches in the South, as well as other houses of worship across the country.

#607

We have established a special task force to help local communities catch and prosecute those responsible, prevent further arsons, and rebuild their churches. 

#608

We must remember we do not have an American to waste. 

#609

We continue to lead the fight to end discrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, age, ethnicity, disability, and sexual orientation.

We support continued efforts, like the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, to end discrimination against gay men and lesbians and further their full inclusion in the life of the nation. 

#612

The President and Vice President remain committed to an Administration that looks like America, and we are proud of the Administration's extraordinary judicial appointments - they are both more diverse and more qualified than any previous Administration. 

#613

We know there is still more we can do to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans, so all people willing to work hard can build a strong future. 

#614

When it comes to affirmative action, we should mend it, but not end it. 

#615

Religious freedom. 

#616

Today's Democratic Party understands that all Americans have a right to express their faith. 

#617

The Constitution prohibits the state establishment of religion, and it protects the free exercise of religion. 

#618

Americans have a right to express their love of God in public, and we applaud the President's work to ensure that children are not denied private religious expression in school. 

#619

Whenever the religious rights of our children - or any American - are threatened, we will stand against it. 

#620

Responsibility to our community and our country. 

#621

Today's Democratic Party believes every American has a duty and a responsibility to give something back to their community and their country. 

#622

We applaud the American spirit of voluntarism and charity. 

#623

As we balance the budget, we must work even harder in our own lives to live up to the duties we owe one another. 

#624

We must shrink the government, but we cannot shrink from our challenges. 
#625

We believe that every school and college in America should make service a part of its basic ethic.

#626

And we want to expand national service by helping communities give scholarships to high school students for community service. 

#627

#629

We will enter the 21st century with the American Dream alive for all, with America still the world's strongest force for peace and freedom.

#630

And the American community will come together, enriched by our diversity and stronger than ever. 

#631

America's best days lie ahead, as we renew our historic pledge to uphold and advance the promise of America: One nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
